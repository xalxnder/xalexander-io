      <title>Breaking Things (Slightly) with a Nexus Upgrade: A Retrospective</title>

&lt;p&gt;Last night, I upgraded Nexus Repository Manager at my job. Nexus acts as a central hub for storing and distributing binaries, serving as a proxy for remote repositories, and hosting private artifacts. It sits behind Traefik, both of which are defined in a Docker Compose file. Since Traefik also needed an update, I figured I’d kill two birds with one stone 😅. I wasn’t nervous about the Nexus upgrade—it was a minor version jump. But Traefik? That made me nervous because it was a big jump.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Set Up a 3 Node Kubernetes Cluster</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, I started a new job as a DevSecOps engineer. During the interview process the team gave me a heads up about what tools they used. I was excited to learn Kubernetes was one of them. I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;Cool, I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few tutorials on this.&amp;rdquo; But after the first few days,I quickly realized I was wrong—I was not ready 😂. I wasn’t just dealing with single-container pods like in the tutorials. I was now faced with terms like &lt;code&gt;Ingress&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CRDs&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;PVCs&lt;/code&gt;… none of it made sense. The days of simple walkthroughs were long gone. I needed a homelab to start building for real. I ordered the following &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5Y4BKZD?th=1&#34;&gt;beelink&lt;/a&gt;, installed proxmox, and hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
