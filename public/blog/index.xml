      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, I started a new job as a DevSecOps engineer. During the interview process the team gave me a heads up about what tools they used. I was excited to learn Kubernetes was one of them. I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;Cool, I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few tutorials on this.&amp;rdquo; But after starting, I realized I was wrong. I was not ready ðŸ˜‚. Within the first two weeks, my head was spinning. I wasnâ€™t just dealing with single container pods like i had before. No no, I was dealling with full-scale deployments, behind proxies, etc. Long gone were the days of tutorials. I needed to &lt;strong&gt;start building&lt;/strong&gt;. I ordered the following beelink. This was going to be my sandbox. I hit the ground running. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll be walking through how to install a three node kuberentes cluster via Kubeadm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
